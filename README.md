Welcome !
=========

This is the repository for my 'Embedded Systems & Robotics' course labs (http://rose.eu.org/2011)

It includes:
* `challenge2011`, a STM32 board bring up folder (with a few application exercices)
* `testbench`, a DC motor control library for this board, used to test our IMU
* `motor`, a DC motor control test using python
